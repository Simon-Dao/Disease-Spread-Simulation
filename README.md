# Disease-Spread-Simulation
While in quarantine, I got really bored and decided to make a simulation that visualizes the spread of a disease 

To download the code just clone or download as a zip file. I highly recommend opening up the program in Intellij Idea.

Anyways feel free to send any pull requests, this is just a basic demo so I'm excited to see what you guys can come up with.
